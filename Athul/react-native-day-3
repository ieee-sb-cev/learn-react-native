1)	A Javascript array is a single variable holding a number of data whereas a Variable is a container of a single data. Array data has the same name and can be accessed using index address. Unlike other languages javascript array can store different datatypes in same name.
2)	
let fruits=["Apple","Banana","Grapes","Orange","Pineapple"];
for(let i=0;i<5;i++)
      console.log(fruits[i]);
3)	let fruits=["Apple","Banana","Grapes","Orange","Pineapple"];
console.log(fruits[2]);
4)	Javascript objects are also variables that can store multiple data in a single name. But in objects unlike arrays, we can store named values as name:value pairs. It is declared as object name followed by curly braces and having name:value pairs inside them.
5)	let person={name:"Athul",age:"20",city:"Areekode"};
console.log("Person Details");
console.log("Name : "+person.name);
console.log("Age : "+person.age);
console.log("City : "+person.city);
6)	var numbers=[2,4,6,8,10];
numbers.push(12);
for(let i=0;i<6;i++)
    console.log(numbers[i]);
7)	Dot notation allows only static keys whereas Bracket notation allows dynamic keys. In Dot notation, we can access a value from the object by a dot operator between object name and the attribute name, this expression can only access the value. In Bracket notation, we can access a value from the object by the object name followed by a bracket with the attribute name inside it, here we can provide modification to the data also.

let result = person.name;
let key=”age”;
person[key]=21;
